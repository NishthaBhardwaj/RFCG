Functional Programming
-----------------------

Functional Prgramming is a programming peradiam in which we have each and every thing in form of
Pure Methemetical Functions
in imperative programming or say in object oriented programming we play with the obejct state
we can pass the object to the method we can get object from the method with modified state os in OOPS
we generally do modify the outer envirorment. Think about pure methemetical funation shoud behave how pure mathemitical
function will behave a pure methemetical funations job would only to perform calculation on the basis of provide
algorithms and data nothing more then that. It should not have any effect on the outer enviroment.
It should have any to do with the object state it just provide the data to perfomr the operation
This funcation programming ovoid the changing state and mutable data.
It is the Declarative type of programming
what to solve rather then how to solve


-------------------------
There are three key concepts of functional programming

1. Functions as first class citizens
2. Pure functions
3. Higher order functions

other than these three key concepts some other important concepts related to FP(Functional Programming)
and these are:

No Side Effects
Referencial Transparency
